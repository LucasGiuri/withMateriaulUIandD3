## Libraries

### Redux
It is a webapp state manager

### Storybook
It is a library to check all the components and their states renders, this allows to see clearly if there are similar components or repeated, and in the other hand if it is necessary design checks.

### Next JS
It is a library to create SSR pages, it should be the SEO solution on web pages with react. In the other hand, this lib can separate the server to the client and this allows to charge the base html from the server.


### Redux Devtools Extension
This is awesome library, you can check step by step with the devtools all the states of our application

### Styled-components
It is a library to use css from the JS, its a nice lib because we can access to components props and use logic in the css, its faster than SASS and doesen't need pre-compilers.
